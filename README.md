# Anonymous_Scripter_Tool
Creates PTC accounts and activates them too.

First off : I found a link in a link towards this. The original post was closed on /r/Pokemongodev.

I've repackaged the files and added missing files and edited a few things so it works a bit smoother.

**Instructions**


After downloading this [ZIPFILE](https://github.com/sodanakin/Anonymous_Scripter_Tool/archive/master.zip) you need to unpack it.

Then open **Anonymous_Scripter.py** with any text editing program.

Look for **emailprefix = 'REPLACEME'**

Replace REPLACEME with a prefix username of your choice.

Look for **password = 'REPLACEME'**

Replace REPLACEME with a password of your choice.

Save the file. 

Now Shift right click in the folder where you extracted the files and where the file you just edited is. 

Look for the option **open command window here.**

In the command window type **pip install -r requirements.txt**

After that everything should be fine and you can run the script from the **Bat.Bat** file. 

Accounts that are correctly activated will be placed in the folder in a text file named accounts.txt
